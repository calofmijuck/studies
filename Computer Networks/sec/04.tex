\section{Network Layer I}
\subsection{Overview of Network Layer}
\subsubsection{Network Layer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transport segment from sending host to receiving host
	\item Sending side encapsulates segments (from transport layer) into \textbf{datagrams}\footnote{`Message' or `packet' that is on the network layer level} and sends them
	\item Receiving side receives datagrams and delivers the segments to transport layer
	\item Network layer protocols exists in \textbf{every} host and router
	\item Router examines header fields in all IP datagrams passing through it - the destination is determined by \textbf{IP address}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Two Key Functions of Network Layer}
\paragraph{Routing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Determines the route taken by packets from source to destination
	\item Routing algorithms help create the forwarding table
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Forwarding}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Moves packets from router's input to appropriate router output
	\item Packet delivery to the next node
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Traditional vs SDN Network}
\begin{itemize}
	\item In traditional IP networks, routing and forwarding is done in the same system (for each router and switch)
	\item In \textit{software-defined network}(SDN), routing function and forwarding function are separated - The central server determines the optimal route, and the switches do the forwarding according to the route given by the central server 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Inside of Router}
\begin{itemize}
	\item router input ports $\rightarrow$ high-speed switching fabric + routing processor $\rightarrow$ router output ports
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Input Port Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item physical layer $\rightarrow$ data link layer $\rightarrow$ decentralized switching
	\item \textbf{Physical layer} determines if the input is 0 or 1 (bit level)
	\item \textbf{Data link layer} - Explained later in Chapter 5. Checks errors, etc.
	\item IP datagram is created after these two layers
	\item IP datagrams may not be processed in real-time, because switching fabric may be busy - datagrams are stored in a buffer called \textbf{input queue}
	\item \textbf{Decentralized switching}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Using header field values, lookup output port using forwarding table in input port memory
		\item The goal is to complete input port processing at `line speed'
		\item \textit{Queueing} is done if datagrams arrive faster than forwarding rate into switch fabric
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Input Port Queueing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fabric may be slower than input ports combined. Then queueing occurs at input queues
	\item Queueing delay and loss may occur due to input buffer overflow
	\item \textbf{Head-of-the-line blocking}: queued datagram at front of the queue may prevent other datagrams in queue from moving forward
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Switching Fabrics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transferring packet from input buffer to appropriate output buffer
	\item \textit{Switching rate}: rate at which packets can be transferred from inputs to outputs
	\item Switching rate is often measured as a multiple of input/output line rate
	\item $N$ inputs: switching rate of $N$ times line rate is desirable
	\item Three types of switching fabrics: memory, bus, interconnection network
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Switching via Memory}
\begin{itemize}
	\item First generation routers
	\item Traditional computers with switching under direct control of CPU
	\item Packets are copied to system's (main) memory, and the IP in the header is read and sent to the destination
	\item Speed is limited by memory bandwidth (2 bus crossings per datagram)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Switching via Bus}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Datagram from input port memory to output port memory via a shared bus (direct copying - faster)
	\item Any input port can be sent to any output port (decided by CPU)
	\item But because a shared bus is used, \textit{bus contention} occurs: switching speed is limited by bus bandwidth
	\item When sending a datagram, an input port and an output port will be used exclusively (limitation of speed, because of a shared bus)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Switching via Interconnection Network}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiple datagrams can be sent at the same time, if the datagrams do not share ports - if the output port has to be shared, collision is inevitable
	\item A lot faster than memory/bus method
	\item Banyan networks, crossbar, other interconnection nets are used for multiprocessing
	\item Banyan networks use less switches compared to crossbars so it may be cheaper, but more susceptible to HOL blocking or collisions 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Output Port Functions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Buffering} is required when datagrams arrive from fabric faster than the transmission rate
	\item \textbf{Scheduling} discipline chooses among queued datagrams for transmission
	\item Scheduling: choosing the next packet to send on link
	\item \textbf{FIFO}\footnote{First in first out, or sometimes FCFS, for first come first served}: send in order of arrival to queue
	\item Discard policy: if packets arrive to a full queue, which packet should be drop?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Tail drop}: Drop the arriving packet
		\item \textit{Priority}: Drop the packet on priority basis
		\item \textit{Random}: Drop a random packet
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Priority Scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Sends highest priority queued packet
	\item Keep two queues, for high/low priority packets, respectively
	\item Multiple classes, with different priorities
	\item Priority class may depend on marking or other header info such as IP source/destination, port numbers etc.
	\item Packets in the low priority queue will be transmitted if the high priority queue is empty - causes problems
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Round Robin (RR) Scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keep multiple classes and queues
	\item Scan all queues round and around. For each cycle, send a \textit{single} packet if the queue is not empty
	\item Each queue is given a chance to send its packets so this method is a bit different compared to priority scheduling
	\item But if there are less (kinds of) packets corresponding to some class, the packets are likely to be processed a lot faster (less delay)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) Scheduling}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Generalized round robin: RR + weights
	\item Each class gets weighted amount of service in each cycle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Internet Protocol Overview}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Network layer functions of host and router
	\item \textbf{Routing protocols} - path selection, RIP, OSPF, BGP\footnote{Routing information protocol, open shortest path first, border gateway protocol}
	\item \textbf{IP protocol} - addressing conventions, datagram format, packet handling conventions
	\item \textbf{ICMP\footnote{Internet control message protocol} protocol} - error reporting, router signaling
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{IP Datagram Format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 20 bytes of header + options (if necessary)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Version}: 4 or 6
		\item \textit{Header length}: offset of data / length of the header + options
		\item \textit{Type of service}: multimedia data, real-time data... rarely used
		\item Datagram length: length of the datagram
		\item \textit{16-bit identifier, flags, fragment offset}: For fragmentation and reassembly of segments in routers
		\item \textit{Time to live}(TTL): maximum number of remaining hops, decremented at each router
		\item \textit{Upper layer}: Upper layer protocol to deliver payload to (TCP or UDP)
		\item \textit{Header checksum}: cycle redundancy check (CRC)
		\item \textit{Source/Destination IP address}: 32 bit
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{IP Fragmentation \& Reassembly}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Network links have \textit{maximum transfer unit} (MTU) 
	\item Each network uses different link types, so they have different MTUs
	\item Large IP datagrams should be divided (fragmented) within the network
	\item Reassembly will occur at the final destination
	\item IP header bits are used to identify and order related fragments
	\item \textit{Identifier}: Datagrams fragmented from large datagrams contain the same ID
	\item \textit{Fragment offset}: Offset of this datagram's data before fragmentation. 13 bits are used for offset, so the value is divided by 8 (flag uses 3 bits)\footnote{MTU - (header size) is divided by 8 to calculate the offset}
	\item \textit{Flag}: 3 bits. First bit is reserved, second bit is for \textit{don't fragment flag} (DF), last bit is for \textit{more fragment flag} (MF)
	\item If MF flag of a packet is 0, it is the last datagrams among fragmented datagrams.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TTL}
\begin{itemize}
	\item TTL field (8 bytes)
	\item Included to ensure that datagrams do not circulate forever (ex. a long-lived routing loop) in the network
	\item Decremented by one each time the datagram is processed by a router
	\item If TTL reaches 0, a router must drop that datagram
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IP Addressing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{IP address}: 32 bit identifier for host, router interface
	\item \textit{Interface}: connection between host/router and physical link
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Routers typically have multiple interfaces
		\item Hosts typically have one or two interfaces
	\end{itemize}
	\item IP address associated with each interface
	\item IP address is \textit{hierarchically addressed}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{IP Address Class}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ICANN}(Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers): allocates addresses, manages DNS, assigns domain names, resolves disputes
	\item IP: \textit{network ID} + \textit{host ID}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Network ID}: ID representing a network group, or a group of hosts
		\item \textit{Host ID}: ID of each host in a network group
	\end{itemize}
	\item Three classes: A, B, C
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Class A: starts with bit 0, network 7 bits + host 24 bits (First byte 0 \(\sim\) 127)
		\item Class B: starts with bit 10, network 14 bits + host 16 bits (First byte 128 \(\sim\) 191)
		\item Class C: starts with bit 110, network 21 bits + host 8 bits (First byte 192 \(\sim\) 223)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Subnets}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Subnet}: a logical sub-division of an IP network
	\item Datagram forwarding is performed by routers
	\item Hosts in the same network can reach each other without intervening router
	\item Too many hosts in a network may increase maintenance overhead
	\item \textit{Divide and conquer}
	\item Division of IP address: Host ID = Subnet number + Host number
	\item Deciding the bit size of subnet number
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Subnet mask}: Indicates the bits that will be used as the network number
		\item If the bit at some position is 1, the bit will be used as the network number
		\item Ex. 255.255.255.0 \(\rightarrow\) 24 bits will be used as the network number
		\item The actual bit size of the subnet number will be: number of 1s in subnet mask - bit size of network ID (depending on IP address class)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Supernetting}
	\item Limitations of IP address classes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Class A: 128 possible network IDs, too small
		\item Class B: approximately 16,000 network IDs \(\rightarrow\) small nowadays
		\item Class C: Only 256 possible hosts, too small
	\end{itemize}
	\item CIDR address format: \texttt{A.B.C.D/x} where \texttt{x} is the number of bits in the network portion of address
	\item Multiple class C addresses can be grouped together to function as a single network group
	\item The hosts in each class C address can be assigned to individual hosts inside the network
\end{itemize}
