\section{Deep Learning Software}
\subsection{CPU \& GPU}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CPU: Central Processing Unit
	\item GPU: Graphical Processing Unit
	\item CPUs have fewer cores, but each core ia much faster and capable, great at \textbf{sequential tasks}
	\item GPUs have more cores, but each core is much slower, great at \textbf{parallel tasks}
	\item GPUs are great for matrix multiplication
	\item NVIDIA CUDA
	\item OpenCL
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deep Learning Frameworks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to build big computational graphs
	\item Easy to compute gradients in computational graphs
	\item Easy to run it all efficiently on GPU
\end{itemize}

Deep learning softwares change fast thus they are omitted here.
